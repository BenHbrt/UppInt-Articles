# Upper-Intermediate Articles Quiz

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project

The inspiration for this project came from my work as an English teacher. I recently taught articles (a, an, the, and Ã˜) to an upper-intermediate level class, and saw the opportunity to code a front-end application to give them extra practice with that area of language.

## The tech side of things

I decided to write this project using the React library, as it was clear to me that it lends itself to the use of components for the different days, as thy all needed to behave in the same way. I chose to use SASS for the styling, as it allows for nested syntax, thus making it much easier to write.
